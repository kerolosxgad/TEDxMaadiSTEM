                <h4 class="writer">Mohamed Abohatab</h4>
                    <p>If we took a deep look at the stories of the most successful people in all the eras, we would definitely sort out many things in common. Although every successful person has his own story with its second to none plot, there are some steps that they all have taken to get to the right track.<br><br> They all had a mindset of commitment, persistence and the stamina to go the long distance. Unfortunately, many people see from a limited lens; they see the single success ignoring the many failures. Certainly, many people know Elon Musk, but a few know about his journey from the bottom to the top. In 2008, Elon Musk had to take a lifesaving decision, a decision that was considered as a milestone in Musk’s life. He had a relatively small amount of budget and he had two companies at the brink of bankruptcy. Logically, it was expected if he put all the money in one company, the other will collapse and if he split the money, both companies will collapse. So, he managed to take the risk and split all what he had got for the sake of the companies’ rebirth. He had that powerful robust mindset that kept energizing his soul with positivity and diminishing his fear with the power of hope. He visualized himself succeeding, so he simply succeeded. It is all about the mindset you have. His company SpaceX failed in launching a space rocket for three times in a row and that went viral. Back then, he was interviewed, and the interviewer said to him “That third failure in a row, did you think to pack this in?” his short yet powerful answer was enough to reflect who he would be today, a role model for millions of people. He answered “Never. I don’t ever give up.”<br><br> 
                    What would you do when your life heroes, role models, cast stones in your direction and when they testify against your idea and criticize it? That was what Musk endured when his heroes, Neal Armstrong and Gene Cernan, testified against commercial space by SpaceX. That was hard on Musk, too hard, in fact, that his eyes were full of tears, but he managed to pass through it, accept their opinions and astonish them with his deeds. Musk proved that limits really exist only in the mind and as commonly said “It always seems impossible until it’s done”. Now, Elon Musk is the CEO of the first private space company to send an aircraft to the space and he is also the CEO of the world number one electric cars manufacturing company, Tesla.<br><br>
                    To conclude, the stronger your mindset is, the more significant you will affect the world and achieve what has been thought to be unachievable. With the right mindset and ambition, you can practically achieve anything. Elon Musk is only one of many robust demonstrations of the unlimited powers of a right mindset. He fought through his life against all hatred to come up on top. So, what are you waiting for?! Set your mindset in the right way and prepare to endure challenges to succeed!
